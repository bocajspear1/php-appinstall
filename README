PHP AppInstall
===================

A script to simplify the process of installing PHP web applications.

Configuration is available in the 'config.php' file.

Instructions:
	The app gives two textboxes, Download Link and Instance Name. 
	Download link is the URL to the .tar.gz (the currently only supported 
	format) file of the wep app you want to install. The Instance Name
	is the name of this instance of the web app. When the button 'Go'
	is clicked, the script will download the file, unpack and uncompress
	the file, and move the files to a subfolder (based on the instance name)
	in the 'test-apps' directory, create a database for the web app
	(also based on the instance name) and then redirect you to a page
	with the generated password, database name and database user where you
	can complete the installation.

NOTE: The database user for this app will need basically all privileges to be
able to create the database and add the permissions.

NOTE: The application is designed for personal use in mind, not a 
muli-user enviroment. The app currently has no form of authentication, 
and security is not extremely rigid. If you want such functionality, 
contact me or fork the app. 

TODO:
> Add capabilities to change where the app is to be installed (file browser, etc.)
> Add support for ZIP files
