PHP AppInstall
===================

A script to simplify the process of installing PHP web applications.

NOTE: The application is designed for personal use in mind, not a 
muli-user enviroment. The app currently has no form of authentication, 
and security is not extremely rigid. If you want such functionality, 
contact me or fork the app. 

TODO:
> Add capabilities to change where the app is to be installed (file browser, etc.)
