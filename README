PHP AppInstall
===================

A script to simplify the process of installing PHP web applications.

Configuration is available in the 'config.php' file.

Instructions:
	1. Get the download link of the PHP web application you would like to install. (It must be in .tar.gz or .zip formats) 
 
	2. Place this link in the 'Download Link' textbox.

	3. Give a the name to the instance of the web application you are installing, this will be used to generate the database, user, and password.
	
	4. Click the Go button, wait until the installation is complete and you are redirected to another page where you are given the database information so that you can complete the installation
	
	5. The app will be installed in the folder given by INSTALL_FOLDER in the config.php file


NOTE: The database user for this app will need basically all privileges to be
able to create the database and add the permissions.

NOTE: The application is designed for personal use in mind, not a 
muli-user enviroment. The app currently has no form of authentication, 
and security is not extremely rigid. If you want such functionality, 
contact me or fork the app. 

TODO:
> Add capabilities to change where the app is to be installed (file browser, etc.)
> Filtering for instance name, check for input that will be longer that the 16 char username limit for MYSQL, other illegal characters should be removed as well
